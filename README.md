# Password-strength-evaluator
This project is a desktop application developed in Python that serves two primary security functions: Password Entropy Evaluation and Secure Storage Demonstration using cryptographic hashing. It is built using the native tkinter GUI library, showcasing proficiency in both cybersecurity concepts and UI/UX design.

Features:
•	Real-time Strength Scoring (0-5): Evaluates password entropy against five industry-standard criteria (length, inclusion of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters).
•	Cryptographic Hashing Demonstration: Displays the SHA-256 hash of the entered password. This simulates the critical step of hashing a password before storage in a database, demonstrating knowledge of defending against rainbow table attacks and data breaches.
•	Platform: Developed to be cross-platform using Python's standard library.
